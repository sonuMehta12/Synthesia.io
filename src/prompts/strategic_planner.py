## ðŸ§¬ INPUT ANALYSIS

### User Profile Analysis
**Learning Topic**: {learning_topic}

**User Profile**:
{user_profile_summary}

**Learning Preferences**: {learning_preferences}
**Current Expertise**: {current_expertise}
**Knowledge Gaps**: {knowledge_gaps}
**Goals & Timeline**: {goals_timeline}

**User-Provided Resources**: {user_resources}

---

## ðŸ§  CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT STRATEGIC ANALYSIS

### Step 1: User Learning DNA Assessment
Think deeply about this specific user:
- **Strengths to leverage**: What existing expertise can accelerate learning?
- **Learning style match**: How do they prefer to consume information?
- **Knowledge gaps priority**: Which gaps are most critical for their goal?
- **Timeline constraints**: How does their timeline affect strategy?

**Your analysis**: 

### Step 2: Learning Topic Complexity Evaluation
Analyze the learning topic: **{learning_topic}**
- **Topic maturity**: Is this well-established or rapidly evolving?
- **Core vs. advanced concepts**: What's foundational vs. specialized?
- **Current developments**: Are there recent trends/changes post-2023?
- **Practical application urgency**: How quickly do they need to apply this?

**Your analysis**: 

### Step 3: User Resource Integration Strategy
Evaluate user-provided resources: {user_resources}
- **Resource quality**: How valuable are these materials?
- **Coverage gaps**: What do these resources miss?
- **Integration approach**: How should these guide the learning path?
- **Priority level**: Should these be foundational or supplementary?

**Your analysis**: 

### Step 4: Agent Selection & Task Allocation
Based on your analysis, decide which agents to activate:

**Available Agents**:
- **Knowledge Synthesizer**: Company database + LLM knowledge synthesis
- **Intelligence Gatherer**: Web research + current trends analysis

**Agent Activation Decision**:
- **Knowledge Synthesizer**: [ALWAYS ACTIVATE] - Why needed for this user/topic
- **Intelligence Gatherer**: [ACTIVATE IF...] - Conditions for activation

**Your decision**: 

### Step 5: Success Criteria & Quality Standards
Define what constitutes success for this user:
- **Learning outcome metrics**: How will we measure success?
- **Personalization depth**: What level of customization is needed?
- **Content quality standards**: What quality threshold must be met?
- **Timeline milestones**: What are the key checkpoints?

**Your criteria**:

## ðŸ“‹ EXECUTION PLAN OUTPUT

Based on your analysis, generate the execution plan in this exact JSON format:

{{
  "plan_id": "Generated unique plan identifier",
  "user_analysis": {{
    "learning_strengths": "Key strengths to leverage",
    "critical_gaps": "Most important gaps to address",
    "learning_style_match": "How their style affects approach",
    "timeline_pressure": "Timeline constraints and implications"
  }},
  "topic_analysis": {{
    "complexity_level": "beginner|intermediate|advanced",
    "topic_maturity": "established|emerging|rapidly_evolving",
    "current_research_needed": true|false,
    "practical_urgency": "immediate|moderate|long_term"
  }},
  "agent_activation": {{
    "knowledge_synthesizer": {{
      "activated": true,
      "primary_task": "Specific task for knowledge synthesizer",
      "focus_areas": ["area1", "area2", "area3"],
      "company_db_priority": "high|medium|low"
    }},
    "intelligence_gatherer": {{
      "activated": true|false,
      "primary_task": "Specific task for intelligence gatherer if activated",
      "research_focus": ["focus1", "focus2"],
      "time_range": "post_2023|current_year|all_time"
    }}
  }},
  "synthesis_strategy": {{
    "integration_approach": "How to combine agent outputs",
    "user_resource_priority": "high|medium|low",
    "personalization_depth": "deep|moderate|basic",
    "quality_threshold": 85
  }},
  "success_criteria": {{
    "primary_metrics": ["metric1", "metric2"],
    "quality_standards": ["standard1", "standard2"],
    "timeline_checkpoints": ["checkpoint1", "checkpoint2"]
  }}
}}

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text
- Base ALL decisions on the user's specific context
- Provide specific, actionable tasks for each activated agent
- Ensure tasks are complementary, not overlapping
- Set realistic quality thresholds based on user timeline

**Generate the strategic execution plan now.**
